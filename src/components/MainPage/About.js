        My name is Tony Soukkeo, and I am a front end web developer! I am very
        passionate about what I do, as I find it super rewarding, designing and
        deploying a small idea, into something bigger that can be seen by the
        whole world! When I'm not coding, you can find me usually find me doing
        a little bit of indoor bouldering
